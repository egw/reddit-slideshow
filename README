REDDIT SLIDESHOW
================

A simple, quick, and dirty reddit slideshow web app based on imgscale[1]
and slidesjs[2] (included.) Load up the page, put in the name of a
subreddit, and press enter. The app will download the first page of the
subreddit and show the images it finds in a slideshow.

The controls are

     left arrow: previous image (or click on the left side of the screen)
    right arrow: next image (or click on the right)
       up arrow: load the next page of the subreddit
     down arrow: load the previous page of the subreddit
         delete: stop the slideshow and remove the slides

clicking on the image itself will take you to the comment page.


TODO
====

I'd like there to be a better pause other than just hovering over the
image. I'd like there to be better feedback when the page is loading
images in the background. I'd like the resize to be smarter -- it
always fits the height of the window, even if the original image is
smaller or wider than the window.
